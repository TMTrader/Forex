## 📌 What Type of Broker is FBS?

FBS operates as a **market maker and ECN hybrid** broker, depending on your account type and trading conditions.

### 🔸 Market Maker (Dealing Desk)

For most retail accounts (e.g., **Cent, Standard, Micro**), FBS acts as a market maker. This means they may take the opposite side of your trades but offer fixed or predictable spreads and bonuses.

### 🔸 ECN (Electronic Communication Network)

FBS offers a dedicated **ECN account** with raw spreads and low commissions — designed for advanced or institutional traders. In this case, FBS connects you directly to liquidity providers without interfering with your trades.

> 📌 **Summary:** FBS is a hybrid broker — both market maker and ECN — depending on account type.
