## 💡 What Are Trading Fees in Forex?

Trading fees in forex typically fall into three categories:

1. **Spread** – the difference between bid and ask prices.
2. **Commission** – a fixed cost charged per traded lot.
3. **Swap** – overnight financing cost (applied when holding positions past server time).

At Exness, these costs depend on the **account type**, **instrument**, and **lot size**.
