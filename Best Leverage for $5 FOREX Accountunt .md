## What is Leverage in Forex?

Leverage lets you **control a larger position** than your actual balance. For example:

* The higher the leverage, the more power — but also **more risk**

---

## Why Trade with a \$5 Account?

* Beginners can test the market without big losses
* Some brokers offer **bonus programs** or **cent accounts**
* Fast way to learn live market behavior

> ✅ Note: Not all brokers allow \$5 deposits — only certain ones specialize in micro trading
