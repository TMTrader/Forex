## 🧠 What Kind of Broker is OctaFX?

OctaFX operates primarily as an **STP (Straight Through Processing)** broker and offers ECN-like conditions. It means your orders are sent directly to liquidity providers without dealing desk interference, minimizing conflict of interest.

### ✔ STP Broker Features:
- No dealing desk
- Tight spreads
- Fast execution
- No requotes
- Transparent pricing

However, OctaFX is **not a true ECN broker**, as it doesn't charge commission on trades but rather earns through spreads. This hybrid STP model balances cost and execution speed for both beginners and advanced traders.
