* But you must still manage **margin exposure**
* High leverage gives flexibility, but demands control

🎯 Remember: **Leverage is a tool, not a shortcut.**

## FAQ

### ❓ Can I trade standard lots with \$1,000?

You *can*, but it’s not recommended unless your stop-loss is very tight. Start with 0.1 lots or less.

### ❓ What’s safer: 1:100 or 1:500?

Lower leverage (like 1:100) is safer but gives less flexibility. Use 1:200–1:300 with proper risk management.

### ❓ Which broker is best overall for \$1,000?

[Exness](https://one.exnesstrack.org/a/english23) and [FP Markets](https://www.fpmarkets.com/?redir=stv&fpm-affiliate-utm-source=IB&fpm-affiliate-agt=56244) offer the best conditions for semi-pro traders at this range.
