## 🏦 What Kind of Broker is AvaTrade?

AvaTrade operates as a **Market Maker** broker.

- **Fixed Spreads:** AvaTrade offers fixed spreads on many instruments, especially in Forex.
- **No Commissions:** Most trades are commission-free; fees are included in the spread.
- **No Direct ECN Access:** You don’t connect directly to the liquidity pool, unlike ECN brokers.

This model is particularly suitable for **beginner to intermediate traders** who prefer **stability and simplicity** over raw spreads and high-frequency scalping.
