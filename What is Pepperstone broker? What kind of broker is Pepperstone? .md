## 2. What Kind of Broker is Pepperstone?

Pepperstone operates as an **ECN/STP (Electronic Communication Network / Straight-Through Processing)** broker. Unlike dealing desk brokers (also known as market makers), ECN/STP brokers **do not take the opposite side of your trade**. Instead, they connect traders directly with a pool of liquidity providers — including banks, hedge funds, and other financial institutions.

### 🔹 ECN (Electronic Communication Network)

This model aggregates quotes from multiple liquidity providers to offer the best available bid and ask prices. It ensures transparency, tight spreads, and fair market pricing. 

### 🔹 STP (Straight Through Processing)

STP means all client orders are passed straight through to liquidity providers without manual intervention or requotes. There’s no dealing desk interference, which reduces conflict of interest between broker and client.

> ✅ **Summary:** Pepperstone is a true ECN/STP broker, providing access to deep liquidity and fast execution without manipulating market prices.
